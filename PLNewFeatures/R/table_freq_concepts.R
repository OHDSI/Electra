#' @description Generate a query to create a table with the most frequent concepts
#' from a specific cohort in a specific domain from the scratch space .
#'
#' @param domain_table name of the domain table from the omop cdm
#' @param domain_concept_id name of the field matching to concept_id from the omop cdm
#' @param scratch scratch space where the cohort is available
#' @param cdm_schema cdm schema name from the dataset
#' @param cohort_id atlas cohort id of the phenotype to be evaluated
#' @param cut_off minimum proportion of patients from the cohort having a code to
#' include the code into the output table
