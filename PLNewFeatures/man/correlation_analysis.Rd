\title{Correlation analysis for code recommendation when evaluating a phenotype}
\usage{
correlation_analysis(
  cohort_id,
  scratch,
  cdm_schema,
  concept_sets,
  conn,
  server,
  drivers_dir,
  max_cores = future::availableCores()\%/\%3L,
  filter_domains_to = c("condition_occurrence"),
  parallel_run = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort_id}{atlas cohort id of the phenotype to be evaluated}

\item{scratch}{scratch space where the cohort is available}

\item{cdm_schema}{cdm schema name from the dataset}

\item{concept_sets}{concepts from the concept set with at least the following
columns (Id = concept_id, Name = concept_name, Domain = as retrieved from ATLAS)}
}
\description{
Create a list of tables with the result of the quantitative correlation
between the appearance of the codes from the concept set and the 30 most
frequent codes per domain between the 6 domains from the omop cdm (Condition,
Drug, Procedure, Device, Measurement, Observation).
